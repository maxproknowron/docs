# Data Security and Privacy FAQs

## Who will have access to the data and documents I have uploaded?
**Only you and members of your team** will have access to the documents you have uploaded. No other client or any user without the authorization can access them in any way shape or form. Your data is safe with us.

## What are your data protection guidelines?
We takes cybersecurity and data protection very seriously. We are compliant with GDPR where we present a privacy notice in a concise and transparent manner. We ask for user consent before tracking, keep analytics anonymous and ensure encryption of all sensitive data. We believe building a robust privacy and security program is the first
step to reinforcing customers’ confidence in how we value, treat, and protect their data.

We are displaying our existing technical and organizational measures (TOMs) to our clients (upon request) and are reviewing them on a 6-month basis in order to ensure the list is up-to-date and comprehensive.

## Do you back up any data?

Our data backup model provides near real-time database replication to ensure customer data is both backed up and available on redundant and geographically dispersed servers. 

Full backups are performed daily and stored encrypted in an environment physically separated from the primary servers to ensure fault tolerance.

## Are you GDPR compliant?

Yes, we are fully GDPR compliant.

## How reliable is your infrastructure?

We deploys our code on top tier cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services that supports comprehensive security and compliance certifications, including PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, GDPR, FIPS 140-2, and NIST 800-171. 

The data-center is located within Europe for EU customers and their data. For network security, systems are behind virtual private cloud where only certain IP’s are allowed to access the system.

All server and network components are continuously monitored by internal staff and by the colocation providers. Access to each system, network device, and application is limited to authorized personnel, and login details within the event logs are
reviewed on a continual basis.
