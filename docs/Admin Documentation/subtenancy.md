# Subtenancy


### Clarification of concepts

**Client:** You are a main tenant if you have a direct commercial relationship with Knowron. This will enable you to resell our white-labeled application with your content to your clients. This is where the concept of subtenant comes to play.


**Subtenant:** Your clients are your subtenants and they have access to the content you have added and set as `Public`. Although if your subtenants add their own products or product lines they will have full access to all features, such as **edit** :pencil2: and **delete** :wastebasket:.

### Access and visibility 


**Public:** If you select the `Public` setting, it means that anyone who has access to that product line, even if they are not part of your organization would be able to see your content such as  tutorials, documents or articles.


**Private:** If you choose the `Private` setting, your content such as tutorials, documents, or articles will only be visible to people within your organization and not to your subtenants. 
This means that only those who have been granted access to your company's internal systems, such as employees or contractors, will be able to see it. The tutorial will not be accessible to anyone outside of your organization.
