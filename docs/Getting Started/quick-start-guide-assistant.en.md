## Step 1. Download the Assistant

The assistant is available for both Android and Apple devices in their respective app stores. They are free of charge to download. Simply click on the links below or scan them with your phone.

| <p align="center">Google Play Store</p>                                                                                                                                            | <p align="center">Apple App Store</p>                                                                                                                                  |

Once you've downloaded the app, simply open it.

## Step 2. Log into the Assistant

Once you open the Assistant, you will see the log in screen (see below).

You only need your email and your KNOWRON password to log onto the system. Your **email** is normally your work email. You can find your **password** in the email you received inviting you to join your organization on KNOWRON (see below).

??? info "Need help finding your password or invitation email?"

    <p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gXh9xJt.png" width="100%"><figcaption>This is where you find your password in the invitation email.</figcaption></p>

    If you do not remember your password, you can reset it right on [suite.knowron.com](https://suite.knowron.com). Simply click on "Forgot Password" and follow the instructions on the screen.

    If you have not received an email inviting you to KNOWRON, please contact your colleagues who are working with it or [request access here](mailto:ali@knowron.com?subject=Request for Access&body=Hi,%0D%0A%0D%0AI am unable to access the system. Please provide support.%0D%0A%0D%0AThank you!).

After you have your email and password, simply type them in and log in!

Note you how you can request access if you have not yet received access to the application by your organization.

## Step 3. Select a product line

Once logged in, you will see our homescreen, prompting you to scan a machine or type the serial number of the machine in front of you.

If you do not yet have a serial number or machine QR code, don't worry, you can select a product line directly.

**Product lines** represent the machines, plants or processes your organization supports which you work with every day. Product lines are there to give the KNOWRON system context - i.e. what are you asking questions about?

Before you continue, you have to select what product line you are interested in. You can tap on the scanning image and then on the products panel on the top of the screen. Alternatively, you can tap on products directly on the home screen.

You will be in the products screen now. Simply select one from the list below, for example: `Epsilon Series`.

You can follow the instructions illustrated below.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FNQueGy.png" width="100%"></p>

If you have a serial number or a machine QR code, things are easier. See below.

??? info "Already have a serial number or machine QR code?"

    If you already have a serial number or KNOWRON QR code, that means that your organization has been working with KNOWRON for a little bit longer. That's great! All your machine data should be available for you to access.

    First, tap on the scan image. Next, you can type the serial number on the field provided. Alternatively, you can scan a KNOWRON QR code directly. Simply tap on the camera icon to enable the camera and point it right at the QR code. The app should identify your machine quickly.

## Step 4. Ask a question

You now have access to the entire documentation for the product line you have selected. Next is to actually ask a question.

Tap on the keyboard icon at the bottom of your screen. That will pull up our Assistant panel, on which you can type in what you want to know. You can also use the microphone icon to ask your question directly using your voice.

Now all you have to do is ask what you want to know. KNOWRON will then go through your entire knowledge base and show you the most relevant results. Try `What is PLA?`.

The results are illustrated below.

## Step 5. Use the Search Screen

Whenever we can, we will show you answers straight from your documentation. If you want to delve deeper, you can use filters and other features, available on the **Search Screen**. Tap on "See more Results" on the Assistant Panel or select the "Search" icon from the homescreen.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/X4GKmM7.gif
" width="300"></p>

We can show you results from the following resources:

- Documents
- Tutorials
- Articles

In the future, we will also be able to show you results from your machine's logbook and much more!

!!! tip "Asking questions will give you better results"

    KNOWRON uses state-of-the-art NLP to understand what you are looking for and bring up the most relevant results. If you formulate your query as a **question**, it will yield **better results**.

    > Example

    Instead of `printer humidity`, ask `"In what humidity can the printer be used?"`

## Step 6. Give feedback

KNOWRON can only get better if you give feedback! Feedback will be taken into account for the search algorithm and will even help your colleagues create better content for everyone in your organization.

You can give feedback in one of two ways:

### Use "thumbs-up" to mark results that helped you

If you found a result that helped you, you can give it a thumbs-up (see below).

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/puislfv.gif
" width="70%"></p>

A thumbs-up takes less than a second and it lets your colleagues know that this will be helpful to them too if they face a similar question. KNOWRON's algorithm will also take it into account: more thumbs-up reactions mean that this result will appear higher in search results in the future.

### Report any missing data for your colleagues to close the knowledge gap

Sometimes, KNOWRON will not find a suitable answer - or the answer might be slightly off. This can happen particularly due to a very broad query or missing data.

If you find that the search results are not helping you in the way that you need, you can click on `Results not helpful` at the top of the search results and give us details on what you were expecting (see below).

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9rXj4j9.gif
" width="70%"></p>

Your colleagues with an editor role, mostly from first-level support or hotline duty will act on your feedback and make sure that the information you need is available to you and your colleagues.
