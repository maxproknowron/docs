Documents related to your product or product line represent one of the content units forming the product's knowledge base. As an Editor, you can upload one single document or an entire file.

!!! tip 
    Documents can be uploaded as a single file or an entire folder. Additionally you can search for your uploaded documents based on name or title.


Clicking on **Upload** prompts a dialog where you can edit the Document's title, change the visibility or add tags.

### **Title**

You can edit the document's **Title**, which will be displayed in the search results, although the original **File name** will also be shown in the Documents table.

### **Date created**

Every document is marked by default with the date it has been uploaded to the system. You can also change the date to the actual creation date of the document. 

### **Visibility**

Setting the Documents' visibility to **Private** would restrict access to users from your organization only. **Public** documents are visible to all users with access to the product line the documents belong to.

Tags can be created by typing in the name of the tag you wish to create in the Tags bar from the `Edit Metadata` dialog.
