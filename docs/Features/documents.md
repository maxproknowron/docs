### Date created

Every document is marked by default with the date it has been uploaded to the system. You can also change the date to the actual creation date of the document. 

### Visibility

Setting the Documents' visibility to **Private** would restrict access to users from your organization only. **Public** documents are visible to all users with access to the product line the documents belong to.
