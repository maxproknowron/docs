# <span style="color:#ac3229"> Search Feedback </span> 

We value your search experience, and that's why we have a Search Feedback feature. This feature allows users with the Admin and Editor roles to answer any open questions users may have regarding a specific search query. Additionally, if an user has provided negative feedback on the quality of answers and search results, it will be visible in the Search Feedback table. We use this information to improve the search results and ensure that your search experience is always satisfactory.


### **Unhandeled Queries**


The unhandled queries table shows the questions that received the "Results not helpful" feedback from users.

As an Admin or Editor, you have the ability to select the correct answer to a user's question by clicking on the Select button. This action will prompt you to the **Add Q&A Pair dialog**, where you can choose the appropriate response. In the top left corner of the dialog, you will see the query that has been made by the user. To find the correct response for the specific query, you can use the search field within the dialog. We want to ensure that our results are accurate and helpful, so your input as an Admin or Editor is greatly appreciated.

Once you have linked your answer to the query asked by users, your answer will be shown as a Verified Answer in the search results.

If you think the answer flagged by the user is correct, then you can delete the Unhandeled Query with the delete :wastebasket: button next to each query.

### **Verified Answers**

In the Verified Answers section, you can view all the queries that have been addressed by Admins or Editors. If you come across a Verified Answer that you believe to be incorrect, or you would like to update it, you can make changes by using the edit :pencil2: feature or unlink it from the query. We encourage collaboration among our team members to ensure that the search results are always up-to-date and accurate.
