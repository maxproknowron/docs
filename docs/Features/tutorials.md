# <span style="color:#FA6E3F"> Tutorials </span> 

**Tutorials** provide an instinctive method of delivering process knowledge regarding a product or product line. They can be used to guide customers through a process or to provide your employees with a step-by-step guide on how to perform a task.


!!! warning 
       Tutorials just like product lines are dependent on your organization. That means that you see the tutorials outside your organsiation although not edit or create them.

Users with the Admin or Editor role can **create**, **edit**, or **delete** tutorials inside their organisation, as well as set them as published or unpublished and change their visibility.

### Step 2. Add a Tutorial Title and an image

We require all tutorial titles to be included in your content. While images are not mandatory, we highly recommend that you include one that accurately represents the content of your tutorial. Adding an image will make your tutorial more visually appealing and help it stand out.

### Step 3. Add Steps to the tutorial 


To add steps to your tutorial, start by breaking down the task into small, manageable steps. Each step should be clear and concise, with specific instructions that are easy to follow.


Once you've written out the steps, consider adding images or videos to go along with each one. This will help users visualize what they need to do at each step and provide additional clarity and context. You can add images or videos by clicking the image placeholder for each step and selecting the appropriate file.

### Step 4. Change visibility and Publish 

Almost done! Now if you want to change the visibility of the Tutorial, you can choose between Private and Public. The Public setting will allow users from outside your organization to **view** the tutorials, while the Private setting makes the tutorial visible only to users in your organization.


If your Tutorial is ready to be shared with your colleagues just toggle the `Publish` button and click on `Save`. If you still want to tweak some changes or it is just not finished, simply click on the `Save` button and your Tutorial will be saved as a draft.
