# Admin Panel

### **Privacy Policy**
If you have been assigned the Admin role, you will have access to certain features that regular users do not. One of these features is the ability to update the Privacy Policy of your organization. To do so, simply navigate to the Admin and from there, you can locate the Privacy Policy section and make any necessary updates.

### **User management**
Finally, the Admin panel also allows you to manage users within your organization. This includes adding new users, modifying their roles and permissions, and removing users who are no longer with the organization. This feature is important for maintaining the security and integrity of your organization's data.
