# Documents 

Documents related to your product or product line represent one of the content units forming the product's knowledge base. You can find all of the documents related to a specific product under `Documents`.

You can search for documents based on their File name or based on their Title. 

## Filters 

If you want to narrow down your search for either a specific time or tags just select the filter in the top right corner of the search bar. 

!!! tip
        You can edit the document's **Title**, which will be displayed alongside the **File name**, which cannot be edited.

Here you can select the `Date created`, which represents the date the document was uploaded to the system. Additionally, you can add `Tags` which make it easier to find specific documents by filtering the search based on those tags. This will show you only the documents matching the selected tags, making it easier to find what you seek.
